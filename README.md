Please find the paper: [1-s2.0-S0164121217301516-main.pdf](https://github.com/Hellwalker/cvbknni/files/9400738/1-s2.0-S0164121217301516-main.pdf)

The cvbknni was based on the knn kernel, with cross-validation to optimize the various knn parameters for various missingness in the data.
The original code was written in Matlab R2017. (Matlab R2016a - R2018b should be fine)


cvbknni was written as IDknnimpute.m and IDknnimpute3.m, the difference was imputation ordering methods.
